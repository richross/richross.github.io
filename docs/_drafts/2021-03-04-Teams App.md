title: Deploying a Teams App Template

## {page.title}!
This is part of the Diversity and Inclusion Teams App installation I previously mentioned.  
In one of the final steps, the Teams App manifest is published to the App Catalog.
Collision stating app with that name already exists.
Searching for the name does not show me any matching apps.
Suggestion from my colleague to look at the app catalog using the Graph API. (appCatalogs/TeamsApps)
Again the file name was not there.  So I searched for the GUID instead and presto, there was an existing app with an external GUID that matched.
I created a new GUID using the tool in Visual Studio (Tools | Create Guid). Updated the manifest and repackaged the files.
This time the app was successfully added to the catalog.
