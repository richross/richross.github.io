title: Getting JSON Properties from Azure CLI
---
## {{page.title}}!
Issue of running Azure CLI configured to show results as Table.  
Table makes this easy to read, but only brings back some of the data.
It is also not in the format where you would typically query the result for specific properties.
Recognize that when querying, you need to set the output parameter to -o json.
